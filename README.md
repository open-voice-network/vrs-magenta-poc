## __PROBLEM__
ttt
Today, there is no straightforward way to deploy a skill or voice application on multiple conversation platforms. Interoperability is pretty much non-existent.

We will cover two use cases:
1. Small companies that do not have their conversation platform
2. Big enterprise companies that can afford their conversation platform
