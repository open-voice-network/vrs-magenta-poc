## __PROBLEM__

Today, there is no straightforward way to deploy a skill or voice application on multiple conversation platforms. Interoperability is pretty much non-existent.

We will cover two use cases:
1. Small companies that do not have their conversation platform [PHASE 1]
2. Forwarded to another conversation agent [PHASE 1]
3. Another enterprise companies will handle conversation platform [PHASE 2]
